# Soundpack for Mystavaria

Hi, this is my first soundpack.  
It’s still small, but it will grow over time.  
In the future, I will also replace some sounds with ones I create myself.

If anyone has ideas for free sounds, feel free to email me at **audiogamer1508@gmail.com**  
or send me an in-game message with `msg atlan <text>`.

to use hp and mana sounds activate your prompt with "prompt on". 

To update, simply run **update.bat**.  
If it doesn’t work, just let me know.  
I don’t know yet how to build in proper update checking since I’m not a programmer,  
but I’ll figure it out eventually.

Have fun playing!
